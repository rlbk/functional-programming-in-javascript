### What is Functional Programming?

-> Functional programming is one of the types of "Programming paradigms" (means - the methods or we can say a set of rules to structure our code to solve a problem).


-> Type of programming paradims:

    1. Procedural Programming

    2. Logical Programming

    3. Functional Programming

    4. Object Oriented Programming


-> So in funciton programming, we create small and reusable functions and by combining them we create another function for solving problems.

-> JavaScript is a multi paradigms language. It supports Object Oriented Programming and Functional Programming both.
